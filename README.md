# Udacity's Grow With Google Scholarship - Ajax
This is my practice repo for Udacity's Grow With Google Scholarship - Ajax. The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each implementation.
