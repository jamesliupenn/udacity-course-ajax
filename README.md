# Udacity's Grow With Google Scholarship - Ajax
This is my practice repo for Udacity's Grow With Google Scholarship - Ajax. The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each implementation.

To test the implementations out, git clone this repo and serve up a HTTP server:
1. Git clone this repo.
2. Update `<your_client_ID>` and `<your_API_key>` in the `app.js` in all three folders. To obtain a client ID for Unsplash and API key for NY Times, visit https://unsplash.com/developers & https://developer.nytimes.com/signup
3. Execute `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>` in the repo folder to serve up the HTTP server.
4. Go to `localhost:<port>` from any browser.
